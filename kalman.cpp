// my implementation of a kalman filter
// kalman filter is a very useful recursive filtering algorithm often used for state estimation. This file will walk you through the initialization of a kalman filter in C++
// kalman filter is used in linear systems to estimate states using the equation: xk = F(xk-1) + B(uk-1) + wk-1, where k and k -1 are the current and previpus timestep respectively
// F is the state transition matrix, xk - 1 is the previous state vector, B is the control input matrix applied to control vector uk-1, and wk - 1 is process noise vector.

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

class KalmanFilter {
    // constructor for the filter
    public:
        KalmanFilter(double initial_value, double process_noise, )

    
}
